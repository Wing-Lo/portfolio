## Description of my portfolio website

The main aim of this website is to showcase my skills and expertise to potential employers. I plan to create a professional portfolio site that highlights my knowledge in web development, IT areas, and coding experience. Through this platform, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and demonstrate my proficiency in these fields effectively.

## Functionality / Features

The portfolio website I've developed features a fully responsive layout, ensuring seamless display across all devices, including desktops, mobile phones, and tablets. It comprises five main HTML pages, each serving a distinct purpose: Home, About, Projects, Blogs, and Contact. These pages provide potential employers with comprehensive insights into my skills, experience, educational background, and past projects. The functionality of the site is further enhanced with a fixed position for the home button and navigation bar, ensuring they remain sticky on top for easy access and navigation to different pages at any time. This user-friendly and informative platform serves as a compelling showcase of my talents and achievements, facilitating easy navigation and engagement for visitors.
